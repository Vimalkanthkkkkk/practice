- Developed an interactive Workflow Automation Builder using Angular 17+ Standalone Components 
  and Angular CDK Drag & Drop (CdkDropList, CdkDrag, transferArrayItem), enabling visual 
  construction of data processing pipelines with 6+ configurable operations including filtering, 
  aggregations (MAX, MIN, SUM, COUNT), and data transformation capabilities

- Implemented dynamic UI with conditional rendering and two-way data binding [(ngModel)], featuring click-to-configure panels, auto-generating 
  empty drop zones, and real-time validation for CSV and JSON data input formats

- Engineered a sequential pipeline execution engine processing multi-step data transformations 
  using TypeScript, component lifecycle hooks (ngAfterViewInit), ViewChild/QueryList decorators 
  for DOM manipulation, and custom business logic for filtering, finding extremes, and numerical 
  aggregations with comprehensive error handling
